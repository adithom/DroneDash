the current implementation utilizes a 6 dimensional state matrix to represent the drone
this deviates from the 13D representation in the paper and done to simplifiy the proof of concept
#todo: add acceleration and drone attitude to the state matrix
#todo: figure out to get the acceleration from the ellipsoid planner
